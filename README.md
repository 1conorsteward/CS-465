Architecture:

In my full stack project, I utilized multiple types of frontend development, including Express with HTML templates, plain JavaScript, and a Single-Page Application (SPA) built with Angular. Express HTML and JavaScript provided a traditional multi-page setup, where each page reloads with new requests, making it easier for static content but less efficient for dynamic, real-time updates. The SPA, on the other hand, offers a more dynamic, seamless experience by loading content without refreshing the entire page. This improves user experience and speed, particularly for applications requiring frequent interaction. On the backend, I used a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its flexibility with unstructured data, scalability, and ease of integration with JavaScript-based code (e.g., Node.js).

Functionality:

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format, distinct from JavaScript, though they share syntax. JSON is used for data interchange between frontend and backend in a structured and readable format, making it ideal for passing data via APIs. For instance, during frontend-backend communication, JSON is used to send data like user inputs or server responses. I refactored my code multiple times during development to improve efficiency, particularly by introducing reusable UI components. These reusable components reduced code duplication and sped up development, while also improving maintainability and consistency across the application.

Testing:

API testing involved verifying request and retrieval methods across endpoints. Testing endpoints included ensuring correct HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and validating input/output data. Security testing introduced complexity due to layers like JWT authentication and CSRF protection. I had to ensure that secure endpoints behaved correctly under valid and invalid requests, and that sensitive data remained protected. Testing methods included unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for multiple components, and API tests to validate endpoint security and functionality.

Reflection:

This course has greatly advanced my professional goals by honing my full stack development skills. I have learned to architect applications using modern technologies like Angular and MongoDB, developed proficiency in backend and API design, and improved my understanding of security implementations. Mastering the integration of these technologies has made me a more marketable candidate, particularly for roles that require comprehensive knowledge of frontend, backend, and database management in a real-world environment.
